        ],
        "hint": "This organelle is responsible for cellular respiration and ATP production",
        "solution": "Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell because they produce energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration. They have a double membrane structure and contain their own DNA. The inner membrane is folded to form cristae which increase the surface area for ATP production.",

        "hint": "Consider the neutral Fe configuration and removal of electrons to form Fe²⁺",
        "solution": "Neutral Fe has configuration [Ar]3d⁶4s². When forming Fe²⁺, electrons are first removed from 4s orbital before 3d. So, both 4s electrons are removed, leaving [Ar]3d⁶4s⁰ as the ground state configuration of Fe²⁺.",

        ],
        "hint": "Use the Punnett square method and consider the 9:3:3:1 ratio",
        "solution": "In F1 generation, all plants will be AaBb\nIn F2, when AaBb × AaBb:\nPossible phenotype ratios are 9:3:3:1\n9/16 show both dominant traits (A_B_)\n3/16 show only dominant A (A_bb)\n3/16 show only dominant B (aaB_)\n1/16 show both recessive (aabb)\nTherefore, 9/16 of F2 will show both dominant phenotypes",
